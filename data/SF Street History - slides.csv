San Francisco's History in Street Names,"This is an extremely condensed history of San Francisco, focused on how various streets got their names. Each factoid is intentionally tweet-sized! You can tap or swipe to go forward and back, or using left and right keys on a desktop.",San Francisco,37.76555,-122.447558,13

Disclaimer,"This history is about streets, and therefore ignores the Ohlone, who were here for thousands of years before the Spanish showed up and began murdering them in the name of the church. There are no laughs to be had about that shit, and they did not build any streets to map.",Ohlone Way,37.7365167,-122.4360941,18

,The very first things to be built in San Francisco were a military installation at Fort Point in the Presidio and the Mission San Francisco de Asís itself. This created a complicated chain of names.,Fort Point,37.80992,-122.476334,17
,"Mission street is named after the Mission, but the mission isn't on that street. The current Mission is on Dolores street. Dolores Street is also named after the mission, because it was also called Mission Dolores.",Misión San Francisco de Asís,37.764212,-122.42644,19
,"The Mission Dolores name came from a creek (now almost entirely buried) that used to run near to the original mission.

,"Church Street is also named for the Mission church, making it the third street to be named after the same Mission, but the original Mission building wasn't on any of those streets!",Church Street,37.76451,-122.428654,18
,"Not on Mission, Dolores or Church, the original Mission was at Albion and Camp streets. There's a plaque.

,"I haven't found anything on Grant Avenue that indicates it's the oldest anything.

,"Frémont had 60 guys with guns under his command, but he was not really part of the army, and so this wasn't America declaring war on Mexico, he was just... some guy being a dick. They kicked him out but he kept coming back and stirring up trouble.",Fremont Street,37.789177,-122.395088,17
,"Frémont's father in law was Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri, who also wanted to annex California. For this service to dickishness, Benton also gets a street. Frémont's shit-stirring eventually led to the Bear Flag Revolt.",Benton Avenue,37.73285,-122.425515,17
,"The Bear Flag revolt was basically a bunch of drunk dudes who declared a republic and made a flag and moved into the house of Mexican general Mariano Vallejo, then in charge, where they stayed, still drunk, for the next 3 weeks until Frémont showed up and took over from them.",Vallejo Street,37.796752,-122.422973,17

,"The other reason he called it San Francisco was to prevent another town from taking that name. Thomas O. Larkin had been about to found a new town called Francisca, after General Vallejo's wife. ",Larkin Street,37.791982,-122.419293,18

,"The gold rush saw San Francisco explode in size from 459 people in 1847 to 30,000 in 1849 and 150,000 by 1870 and 342,000 by 1900. People made money mining gold but also in lots of nefarious ways.",Sutter Street,37.787251,-122.424196,13
,David Broderick literally made money by inventing a standardized gold currency for San Francisco (there wasn't enough paper money) and profited by selling $4 worth of gold as a $5 coin.,Broderick Street,37.786491,-122.441832,17
,"James Lick made his money by ignoring gold and buying land, spending less than $40,000 to buy lots in San Francisco in 1847 that then become worth millions by 1849. He never spent any of his money but gave it all away before he died, including founding an observatory.",US 101 is also called the James Lick Freeway,37.705749,-122.394252,14
,"Joshua Norton, aka ""Emperor Norton"" also showed up in San Francisco around this time.

She donated her millions to charitable causes and also bequeathed a fountain of questionable taste to the city.",Lotta's Extremely Ugly Fountain,37.787861,-122.403321,19
,"In 1851 gold rush money and explosive growth had turned SF into a lawless town. Sam Brannan showed up again, creating a Committee of Vigilance to find and summarily hang criminals.

,By 1863 the gold rush was mostly over but William Chapman Ralston discovered that instead of gold there was an enormous amount of silver in the famous Comstock mine and made a fortune getting it out. ,Ralston Street,37.717144,-122.468927,17
,"In the 1860s they tried to name a town after Ralston but he modestly refused, so instead they decided to name it after his modesty -- hence the town of Modesto, California. (Ralston Street in SF came much later)","Modesto, CA",37.637105,-120.996722,8
,"In 1865 Adolph Sutro arrived and told Ralston he could build a tunnel to help him get the silver out more cheaply and safely. The tunnel took forever to build and by the time it was done the silver was all mined out, but selling stock in the tunnel itself made Sutro very rich.",Sutro Tower was built in 1973 on land owned by his grandson,37.75537,-122.452134,17

,"Also in Golden Gate Park is the De Young Museum, rebuilt in 2005.

The park's superintendent hated all three.",De Young Museum,37.770883,-122.46833,16
